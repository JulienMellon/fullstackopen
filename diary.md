# My Full Stack Open Diary

## Why is there a Diary?

well, i have this weird habit of wanting to document the journey as I go, in my private diaries, but I want to learn in public.  this file is meant to be a diary of progress specifically for fullstackopen.  just a stream of consciousness, written at the beginning or the end of any given session.  I hope one day it can help someone else digest what happened here.
