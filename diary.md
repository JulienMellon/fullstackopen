# My Full Stack Open Diary

## Why is there a Diary?

well, i have this weird habit of wanting to document the journey as I go, in my private diaries, but I want to learn in public.  this file is meant to be a diary of progress specifically for fullstackopen.  just a stream of consciousness, written at the beginning or the end of any given session.  I hope one day it can help someone else digest what happened here.

### October 27, 2023

Today I started my diary.  I had some  family events that kept me very busy over the past several months and ended my last run at this fullstackopen certification.  I still intend to do the whole program, so I've started making commits again :).  Also, i kind of skipped part 0, so some of the most recent commits are from "part1".  It felt really nice to write some JSX after a long break.
