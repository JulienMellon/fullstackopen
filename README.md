## my public repository for fullstackopen exercises

Well, now I've got a repo and I plan to keep the file structure as recommended:

part0
part1
  courseinfo
  unicafe
  anecdotes
part2
  courseinfo
  phonebook
  countries
So, each part has its own directory, which contains a directory for each exercise set (like the unicafe exercises in part 1).

The exercises are submitted one part at a time. When you have submitted the exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any missed exercises for that part.

##Update 10-27
Hey so I had some busy family events that ended my last run at this fullstackopen certification.  I still intend to do the whole program, so I've started making commits again :).  Also, i kind of skipped part 0, so some of the most recent commits are from "part1".  It felt really nice to write some JSX after a long break.
