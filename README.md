## my public repository for fullstackopen exercises

Well, now I've got a repo and I plan to keep the file structure as recommended:

part0
part1
  courseinfo
  unicafe
  anecdotes
part2
  courseinfo
  phonebook
  countries
So, each part has its own directory, which contains a directory for each exercise set (like the unicafe exercises in part 1).

The exercises are submitted one part at a time. When you have submitted the exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any missed exercises for that part.
